# human-in-the-loop-nlp

## Overview
This repository presents a human-in-the-loop NLP governance architecture focused on
auditability, role stability, and ethical safeguards for conversational AI systems.

The project emerged from a real-world analysis of conversational AI failure modes,
including role drift, authority ambiguity, and post-hoc response instability.

## Core Principles
- Human authority is non-negotiable
- AI systems must remain assistive, not directive
- All decisions must be auditable
- Ethical constraints are architectural, not optional

## Scope
This repository is intended for:
- NLP engineers
- AI governance researchers
- Safety and ethics reviewers
- Multi-agent system architects

## What This Is Not
- Not a benchmark
- Not a chatbot demo
- Not a marketing artifact

This is a governance-first technical exploration.
